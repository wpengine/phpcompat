Make sure your plugins and themes are compatible with newer PHP versions.

== Description ==

The WP Engine PHP Compatibility Checker can be used by any WordPress website on any web host to check PHP version compatibility.

This plugin will lint theme and plugin code inside your WordPress file system and give you back a report of compatibility issues for you to fix. Compatibility issues are categorized into errors and warnings and will list the file and line number of the offending code, as well as the info about why that line of code is incompatible with the chosen version of PHP. The plugin will also suggest updates to themes and plugins, as a new version may offer compatible code.

**This plugin does not execute your theme and plugin code, as such this plugin cannot detect runtime compatibility issues.**

**Please note that linting code is not perfect. This plugin cannot detect unused code-paths that might be used for backwards compatibility, and thus might show false positives. We maintain a [whitelist of plugins](https://github.com/wpengine/phpcompat/wiki/Results) that can cause false positives. We are continuously working to ensure the checker provides the most accurate results possible.**

**This plugin relies on WP-Cron to scan files in the background. The scan will get stuck if the site's WP-Cron isn't running correctly. Please see the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/faq/) for more information.**

= Update to PHP 7.3 =
* Use this plugin to check your site for compatibility up to PHP 7.3!
* As of [July 2019](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/), 20.1% of WordPress websites run a PHP version older than PHP 5.6.
* These versions of PHP have been [deprecated and unsupported](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) for over 2 years.
* Only 54.1% of WordPress websites run PHP 7, the current main version of PHP.


= Disclaimer =
*While this plugin is written to detect as many problems as accurately as possible, 100% reliable detection is very difficult to ensure. It is best practice to run comprehensive tests before you migrate to a new PHP version.*

The plugin was created by WP Engine to help the WordPress community increase adoption of modern PHP versions. We [welcome contributors](https://github.com/wpengine/phpcompat) to this plugin, and are excited to see how developers and other WordPress hosts use this plugin.

== Installation ==

*Note: If you have WordPress 2.7 or above you can simply go to 'Plugins' > 'Add New' in the WordPress admin and search for "PHP Compatibility Checker" and install it from there.*

To manually install:
1. Upload `phpcompat` to the `/wpengine-wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

You will find the plugin options in the WP Admin `Tools => PHP Compatibility` menu. Once you click `run` it will take a few minutes to conduct the test. Feel free to navigate away from the page and check back later.

There are WP-CLI commands available see the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/other_notes/) tab for details.

== Other Notes ==

PHP Compatibility Checker includes WP-CLI command support:

`wp phpcompat <version> [--scan=<scan>]`

`
<version>
    PHP version to test.

[--scan=<scan>]
  Whether to scan only active plugins and themes or all of them.
  default: active
  options:
    - active
    - all
`
Example: `wp phpcompat 7.2 --scan=active`


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Will this work outside of the WP Engine hosting account?

    Yes, this plugin can be used any ANY WordPress website on ANY host.

2. Are there WP-CLI commands available?

    Yes, this plugin does extend WP-CLI and provide commands. See the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/other_notes/) tab for details.

3. A plugin I created is listed as not compatible, what should I do?

    We maintain a [whitelist of plugins](https://github.com/wpengine/phpcompat/wiki/Results) that cause false positives. If your plugin shows up as incompatible but you think that is wrong, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wpengine/phpcompat/issues/new) on the project, or email wordpress@wpengine.com with info about your plugin and why you know it is compatible (you have automated tests, the failure is on backwards compatibility code paths, etc).

4. Can I use this to test non-WordPress PHP Projects?

    Yes! While you cannot use this WordPress plugin to test your non-WordPress projects, you can use the [Open Source PHPCompatibility Library](https://github.com/wimg/PHPCompatibility) that this plugin is built on.

5. Why was my plugin/theme skipped?

    Some servers have timeouts to prevent long running queries, this is commonly 60 seconds. This can prevent the checker from being able to process large themes or plugins. You should check with your host to see if this timeout can be temporarily removed. The best way around this timeout issue is to run this plugin on a [local copy](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/) of your site, or you can use the WP-CLI command.

    You can use the filter `wpephpcompat_scan_timeout` to customize the scan timeout. See [this](https://gist.github.com/octalmage/07f26e0d1f25cea9a8ca92ebc67a3a14) for an example.

    Setting the timeout to 0 disables the cron/timeout.

6. The scan is stuck, what can I do?

    The PHP Compatibility Checker relies on WP-Cron to process plugins/themes in batches, this is necessary to avoid server timeouts. The scan will get stuck if your site's WP-Cron isn't functioning. You can look into this using [WP Crontrol](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/). The cron is called `wpephpcompat_start_test_cron`. This could also be an issue if your site is using basic authentication.

    You can also use the [WP-CLI command](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/other_notes/) or disable the timeout to avoid using WP-Cron.

7. I found a bug, or have a suggestion, can I contribute back?

    Yes! WP Engine has a public GitHub repo where you can contribute back to this plugin. Please open an issue on the [Plugin GitHub](https://github.com/wpengine/phpcompat). We actively develop this plugin, and are always happy to receive pull requests.

    The plugin was created by WP Engine to help the WordPress community increase adoption of modern PHP versions. We welcome contributors to this plugin, and are excited to see how developers and other WordPress hosts use this plugin.
